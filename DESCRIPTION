Description: The configuration format defined by TOML (which stands for
 "Tom's Obvious Markup Language") specifies an excellent format suitable
 for both human editing and reading as well as the obvious uses of a
 machine-readable format. This package uses Rcpp to connect the excellent
 cpptoml parser written by Chase Geigle (in C++11) to R.
