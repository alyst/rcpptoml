Maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
Description: The configuration format defined by TOML (which expands to
 "Tom's Obvious Markup Language") specifies an excellent format suitable
 for both human editing as well as the obvious uses of a machine-readable
 format. This package uses Rcpp to connect the cpptoml parser written by
 Chase Geigle (in modern C++11) to R.
OS_type: unix
SystemRequirements: A genuine C++11 compiler. The version of g++ that is
 currently in Rtools is insufficient.
