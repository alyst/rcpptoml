Description: The configuration format defined by TOML (which stands for
 "Tom's Obvious Markup Language") specifies an excellent format suitable
 for both human editing as well as the obvious uses of a machine-readable
 format. This package uses Rcpp to connect the excellent cpptoml parser
 written by Chase Geigle (in modern C++11) to R. 
SystemRequirements: A genuine C++11 compiler. The version of g++ in Rtools 
 is not sufficient.
